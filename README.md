# Create Blackjack using Python
play a blackjack application written in python

If you are new to python like I was and you want to know what you need to access this code for your own you have some options:

You could download some software to code python, I personally went out and got the latest version of pyCharm just so I could
learn to use some different software than Visual Studio (which is another option; you may need to use NuGet to access the right
project types).

Or you could go to this site: https://repl.it/ - Here you just select the language you want to code in (in this case python) and it creates an environment for you to code, debug and run your application in, all without signing up for any sort of membership or downloading any kind of software. Highly recommend it for learning purposes.
